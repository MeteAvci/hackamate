# ⚡ HACKAMATE

**Automation arsenal for the lazy genius.**

> *"I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage."*  
> — Friedrich Nietzsche

Hackamate is a collection of **surgical automation tools** designed to eliminate repetitive digital labor. No bloated frameworks. No unnecessary dependencies. Just scripts that work.

## 🧬 Philosophy

- **Simplicity > Complexity** – If it needs a 50-line config, it's overengineered
- **Automation > Repetition** – Anything done twice should be scripted
- **DOM > API** – When they paywall the API, we go direct
- **Fallback > Failure** – When Plan A breaks, Plan B kicks in automatically
